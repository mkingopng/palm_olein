# palm_olein

analysis and forecasting of palm olein price and market dynamics

# Objective of the project

- Build automatic pipeline to collect macro economic data from published sources
- Investigate and build models to infer price of palm oil in the long-, mid-, and short-term future
- Decision making whether to buy or hold at spot, or the forwards

# Some directions of thinking

From Michael:

- labour shortages in 2020 contributed to a supply constrain. Most
  malaysian palm oil plantations rely on indonesian labour. With the COVID lockdowns in 2020 there was annecdotally an
  impact on supply.
- the indonesian government imposed restrictions on exports to control domestic inflation (cost of oil is a key part of
  their "basket of goods" for measuring CPI).
- the dynamics in related markets like soy, linseed, canola, grapeseed, olive oil and other vegetable oils will have a
  bit impact on the price of palm oil.
- Weather will have a big impact on supply of all these

# Visualisation

- geo plot country-wise consumption of palm oil (cannot easily get data against consumption)
  - geo plot country-wise production of palm oil (production is the proxy for consumption)
  - or import data for a country (quanbo)
  - temperature pallet 
- land cultivation fix
- Total Vegetable oil production by crop fix
- Comparision between veg oil production and land used

# Some Hypothesis about the price dynamic

## Supply side

According to Michael,

- The price dynamic is likely to be driven by the supply side instead of the demand side
  - Amount of land used (biggest contribution to the production)
  - Political policy
- Demand side seems to be stable
