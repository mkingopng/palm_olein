# palm_olein

analysis and forecasting of palm olein price and market dynamics

# Objective of the project

- Build automatic pipeline to collect macro economic data from published sources
- Investigate and build models to infer price of palm oil in the long-, mid-, and short-term future
- Decision making whether to buy or hold at spot, or the forwards

# Some directions of thinking

From Michael:

- labour shortages in 2020 contributed to a supply constrain. Most
  malaysian palm oil plantations rely on indonesian labour. With the COVID lockdowns in 2020 there was annecdotally an
  impact on supply.
- the indonesian government imposed restrictions on exports to control domestic inflation (cost of oil is a key part of
  their "basket of goods" for measuring CPI).
- the dynamics in related markets like soy, linseed, canola, grapeseed, olive oil and other vegetable oils will have a
  bit impact on the price of palm oil.
- Weather will have a big impact on supply of all these
