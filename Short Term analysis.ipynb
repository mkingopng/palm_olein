    "# Introduction\n",
    "There are a number of forces at play that make this an interesting topic\n",
    "- palm oil demand growing continuously year-on-year\n",
    "- the amount of cultivation and production has increased\n",
    "- increased land use is the primary driver of increased production volumes\n",
    "- increased yields have also contributed\n",
    "- there is an increasingly negative view of palm oil and its role in driving deforestation. \"palm oil free\" is now a prominent issue and should cause downward pressure on demand\n",
    "- labour shortages due to restrictions imposed during COVID 19 had an effect in 2020 and the \"stickiness\" of agricultural production means the effect of this will take time to work through the supply chain. This may be one of the causes behind lagging supply.\n",
    "- global shipping disruptions and delays have impacted trade broadly and palm oil is affected. This should have a dampening effect on demand\n",
    "- Public policy in indonesia constraining exports will have had a dampening effect on supply\n",
    "- El nino weather conditions will have a postive impact on supply, however the timing of this impact is unclear at this time"

    "# Problem statement\n",
    "Since late 2020, palm olein prices have surged to break one record after another. Prices today are at an all-time high. It is unclear what is driving this price surge. There has been no obvious structural change to the market that could easily explain such a sustained bull market. This implies that the current prices are unsustainable and there will be a market correction at some point.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the meantime, business need to plan and the uncertainty about future prices makes this task challenging, as margins are <8% for most actors. Tha palm oil market affects many industries including foods, industrial applications (consumer goods like soaps, detergents & cosmetics) and energy. In a market where price has increased by 400% in 24 months, accurately forecasting future prices and making appropriate decisions become mission-critical."

The supplier closes their order book on the 21st of the current month. by the 21st of the month, purchasing must choose whether to place forward orders for 1-3 months at the current price, or to wait for the new price in 10 days."
