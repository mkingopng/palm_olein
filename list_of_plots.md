# Brief: 
The client is a food manufacturer that uses palm olein as a raw material. 
Recently, the client has struggled with the rapidly increasing price of palm olein 
and the uncertainty around cost of goods is making it difficult for the client 
to make informed decisions about selling price changes, purchasing commitments, 
message to market etc.

The client would like a tool that helps them make better, more informed decisions.
Decisions may include:
* Whether to buy at spot or forward
* When to buy and at what price
* When to increase selling prices and buy how much
* What messages to signal to the market regarding future price expectations
* Others...

# Preparation:
First we must analyse the market, which is of course the purpose of analytics.
At the conclusion of our analysis, we should be able to present a clear and 
easily understandable explanation of the forces or drivers that govern the 
behaviour of the market, and what expectations are for those drivers.

The purpose of this analysis is manifold:
1. we want to have a clear understanding of the market drivers
2. we want to know where to find both long term and up-to-date information 
about those market drivers
3. We want to have a clear understanding of how drivers interact to determine 
the outcome: price

These are all inputs into the model that will ultimately be the outcome of our 
engagement. In addition to the initial research and development work, Deloitte 
would also charge the client for the ongoing maintenance cost of the reporting 
tool, and the model.

conclusion: demand and trade has grown over time. Demand growth is a function 
of population growth and economic development. As per capita GDP increases, 
consumption of dietary fats increases. Both have occurred most in China and 
India, who are coincidentally the highest importers

* palm oil production over time
* palm oil exports over time

* land used for palm oil
* land used for vegetable oil
* productivity per hectare by oil crop

conclusion: production has continued to grow. palm oil's rate of production 
increase has been faster than other oil crops due to its low cost of production
however the rate at which land used for production is lower than the rate of 
increase on volume of production and its high yield per hectare

* price over time
* cost per ton of palm oil relative to other oils
conclusion: 

Drivers of Demand Growth
* population growth
* per capita GDP

Drivers of Supply Growth
* land clearing and land under cultivation
* increased productivity
